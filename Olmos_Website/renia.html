                <h2>Renia Shterenberg, Executive Director</h2>
                <p><strong>Renia Shterenberg</strong> has been Executive Director of the San Antonio, Texas based chamber group Olmos Ensemble since the retirement of the founder, Mark Ackerman, in 2015. In her four year tenure with the organization, the group has moved its concert location to the centrally located Laurel Heights United Methodist Church, raised audience attendance and awareness, organized two successful fundraising Gala events, and produced two CDs. Additionally, the group has implemented a three-concert Summer Concert Series in the month of August, which in 2019 became the first of its kind to be live broadcast by Texas Public Radio's KPAC 88.3. They have increased their operating budget, and have had balanced or surplus budgets in 3 of the 4 years she has been Executive Director. Renia has spearheaded annual fall concerts which are food and fund drives supporting the San Antonio Area Food Bank, and spring concerts that serve as a way to highlight the talented small business entrepreneurs of San Antonio - most recently, Lily's Cookies and Niche Ladies Clothier have benefited from exposure at these events. The group has collaborated with such major artists as Vadim Gluzman (violin), Timothy Jones (baritone), William Wolfram (piano), and Jon Kimura Parker (piano).<br><br>Renia plays in the first violin section of the San Antonio Symphony, a position she has held since 2005. She was Acting Assistant Concertmaster for the 2018-2019 season, and annually is asked to coach string groups for the Youth Orchestras of San Antonio. Renia lives in San Antonio with her husband, clarinetist Ilya Shterenberg, and their two children. Her hobbies include gardening, cooking, cycling, running, snorkeling, hiking, and spending quality time watching movies with her cat, Snowy.</p>
